# Sequences-Time-Series-and-Prediction
Sequences, Time Series and Prediction by deeplearning.ai
 
## week 1- This week i explored the nature of time series data, and you saw some of the more common attributes of them, including things like seasonality and trend. I looked at some statistical methods for predicting time series data also.

## Week 2- I explored time series data, and seen how to split it into training and validation sets for training a DNN.

## week 3- I learned how to built DNNs with RNNs and LSTMs.
